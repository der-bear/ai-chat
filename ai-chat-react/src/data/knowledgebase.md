LeadExec Concepts 

A fundamental overview of the main components of the system 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

Introduction: 

LeadExec is a browser-based web application designed for automated lead distribution. The application provides functionality to accept inbound leads from internal sources or third-party partners and deliver leads outbound to multiple endpoints using industry-standard practices. Two of the most essential parts of LeadExec are found in the Account Settings. They are the Lead Type and Automation settings. Lead Types: The first thing that needs to be configured in a new LeadExec account is your Lead Type, where you will set all your lead fields. It is possible to have multiple lead types in your account if you work within a number of different verticals. Many parts of the system are based on and work from the Lead Type, which is why it is a crucial first step in configuring your account. 

Automation Preferences: Another major component of the system is Automation preferences. These settings are found under the Client Settings section of the Account Settings page. These options set the delivery automation that will be used by default throughout the system. These settings can be overridden in lead source campaign settings if needed. 

LeadExec UI Overview: 

The sections below provide details on the different areas of the system, which are found in the left-hand menu in the main UI of LeadExec. 

Leads: 

The Leads section provides access to all lead data and distribution reports. The two primary screens used in this section are All Leads and Distribution. Inbound: 

The Inbound section of LeadExec relates to how leads come into the system and provides access to configure and manage your Lead Sources. The main components in this area are Lead Sources and Campaigns. Lead Sources: Lead sources can be defined as the location from which a lead was submitted. This can include many different examples, but the most common is a website or 3rd party affiliate partner. Campaigns: Campaigns exist to allow a lead source to send in multiple different types of leads. This can range from different types of leads and lead categories to splitting leads out by criteria for different cost points. Think of a campaign as a receiving avenue within a lead source. An example would be if your lead source is your website, you could have a campaign for each lead capture form located on that website. This way, an account can see how many leads they received from their website as a whole, but also can drill down to see which lead forms are performing better. You can also think of campaigns as a way to limit what a 3rd party affiliate partner can send in. For example, if you had an affiliate that you were paying $35 for California leads, but only $15 for Nevada leads. You can use campaigns (with criteria) to limit which accounts and which price points these leads are assigned to. Outbound: 

The Outbound section of LeadExec relates to leads posting out of the system and provides access to your client configurations and associated screens. Two of the main components of Clients are Delivery Methods and Delivery Accounts. Clients: Clients can be defined as the location where a lead will be delivered. There are a lot of different terms when describing a client. Some examples are branch, dealer, and lead buyer. Each of these fall under the generic term "Client". In corporate applications, most companies do not sell leads to their clients but instead, use LeadExec as a tool to distribute leads down to their branches and dealers to be worked by agents. However, in non-corporate applications, companies may sell leads and create orders to determine how many leads can be delivered to a lead buyer. Throughout LeadExec, we use the term Client to roughly describe where a lead will ultimately end up. Clients receive leads through delivery methods and delivery accounts. Delivery Methods: Delivery method settings are found in the Client Details screen and determine how a lead will be delivered to a client. There are multiple ways that a lead can be delivered, such as HTTP Webhook, Ping/Post, Email, and SMS. Delivery Accounts: Where delivery methods determine how a lead will be delivered, a delivery account determines what type of lead will be delivered through criteria. Delivery accounts are comparable to lead source campaigns as they provide options to qualify the lead for the client as well as set distribution and lead quantity rules. Other Noteworthy System Concepts: 

Understanding Channels: Think of Channels of what type of lead is being sent into the system, or how the lead is posted into your account. There are four Channel types. The type of Channel is selected when setting up campaigns and can determine how leads are processed through the system for delivery. 

Web Leads: Web leads are the most common type of lead processed in LeadExec. These are leads coming from a website/landing page or third-party lead source. 

Phone Leads: Phone leads are leads entering the system through the LeadExec IVR system. Chat Leads: Chat leads are created on a landing page or website using the LeadExec AI chatbot. Ping/Post Leads: Ping/Post leads are Web Leads that are first pinged into the system from your Lead Source to ensure there is coverage for the lead and that revenue requirements are met.

Use the quality control to stage leads, verify them prior to delivery. 

Written by Gabriel Buck Updated over a week ago 

There are two ways leads can be delivered from Quality Control: by using the Validate function or by using Find Client. 

Validating leads in Quality Control: 

You can find the "Validate" option in the top menu or through the options menu by right-clicking on a lead. Using the validate function on this screen will process the selected lead and distribute it through automation. This feature is used for leads that have been reviewed and considered viable for your clients. Once a lead is validated, it will be processed for automated delivery and moved out of Quality Control. 

Using Find Client in Quality Control: 

To send a lead to a client from the quality control bin using Find Client, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Go to your Leads section on the left-hand navigation bar 2. Click on Quality Control 

3. Select the lead type that contains the leads you want to send out. 4. Select the lead that you wish to send. 5. Once you have verified the information, select a lead and right-click. This will generate a popup menu with options to perform on the lead. Click Find Client. 

4. The list of matching clients will appear. Select the client to whom you wish to send the lead and click Send.

LeadExec Account Introduction 

This article provides steps for basic account configuration and testing 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

The ClickPoint team welcomes you to LeadExec! We are very excited to present our new browser-based version of LeadExec. The software retains its already powerful features for automated lead distribution while adding an updated UI, new advanced features, and mobile capabilities. In this article, we outline a few steps to take that will allow you to quickly see how the system operates and interacts with your partners. Reviewing your Lead Type: LeadExec is pre-populated with the lead type you selected for your associated vertical, which we'll use for our testing. You can review the lead type by going to the Lead Type section in the Account Settings by clicking the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. Here, you can utilize the Lead Type Editor, where you can review and make adjustments to an existing lead type or create a new one. For now, we'll use the default lead type for this exercise. 

Setting up a test Lead Source: Now that we've reviewed the lead type, let's create a Lead Source and Campaign. Step 1: Select the "Create" button to add the name of the lead source, the email associated with the lead source, and username and password for the Vendor Portal. This will bring you to the Lead Source details page. Step 2: Now you've added your Lead Source, you'll create a Campaign by clicking the "Create" button in the Campaigns section of the screen. In the popup window, you'll name your Campaign and select your Lead Type. We'll leave the default settings in place for "Use Quality Control" and "Status." Lastly, set the price you will pay the source per lead. Step 3: Navigate to the Lead Forms and click "Add." and name the form, i.e., Test Form, and click "Save." You now have a lead form created which you'll use in a later step. Click the "Navigate To" button to populate the lead form in a new tab. Leave this open for now, and go back to your LeadExec tab. 

Setting up a test Client: Next, we'll set up a Client. Click List under Clients in the left-hand menu, then click "Create." In the modal, you will add the Company Name, First Name, Last Name, Email, and set Status to "Active." You'll also add login information used for the Client Portal here. The portal allows your clients to review all leads you've delivered to them and where they can manage their returns. We'll be using this as part of our testing, so take note of the login information for later. 

_In the next two steps, we'll create a Delivery Method and a Delivery Account. A Delivery Account controls what type of lead is delivered, while a Delivery Method controls how a lead is delivered. Creating a Delivery Method: Under Delivery Methods, select "Create" and name your Delivery Method. In this case, we'll name it Portal Test. This is the easiest delivery method configuration. Instructions on configuring other delivery method types, such as JSON, HTTP POST, and EMAIL, are noted later in the article. Creating a Delivery Account: First, name the Delivery Account, set the Status and Lead Price, and turn on Automated Delivery. For our testing, let's also set some criteria to only allow Arizona leads to be sent to this client. Go to the criteria section and click "New," then select Lead Field and the field "State" in the dropdowns. Now set the operator to "Is any of" and choose a state to filter your leads for. In this example, we're using Arizona, which will only allow leads with this state to be delivered through this Delivery Account._ 

Testing your configuration: Now that you have your Lead Source and Client set up, let's submit a test lead using the lead form you have opened in the other tab. To submit a lead, fill out the fields on the form and click "Submit." Make sure you set the state on the lead to be the same as the state set in your Delivery Account criteria. Once the form delivers the lead, the system will generate a response informing you that the lead was accepted and providing a lead UID. You can now see your lead in the Leads List screen. You can also see the lead details and the send information of where the lead was delivered by selecting "View Send Information" from the Options dropdown in the top menu. 

To view the lead in the client portal, go to the Client Portal tab in the Client Details screen. This provides a link to the portal, where you'll enter the username and password you set for the client. The portal can act as a micro CRM for the client and is where they can manage their lead returns. This exercise shows the basics of how the system works. Please see the articles below for more detailed information on other parts of the system. Setting Up Lead Sources: Further information on configuring lead sources and campaigns.

Run Automation: You can access the Run Automation feature by selecting Options in the top menu of the Lead List screen or by right-clicking on the lead and choosing Run Automation from the popup menu. This feature allows you to process the lead for delivery through automation. 

Find Client: 

_By using Find Client, the system will scan all clients' delivery accounts to find clients that have criteria that match the lead. The results will also include clients who do not have automation selected for their delivery accounts, yet whose criteria match. To access the Find Client feature, you can either select Options from the top menu on the Lead List screen or right-click on the lead and choose Find Client from the popup menu. Once you've selected Find Client, the system will scan your client list and return a list of all eligible clients for that lead. You can then click the Send icon to deliver the lead to your chosen client._ 

Send to Client: 

The "Send to Client" option enables manual lead delivery to clients, bypassing client-specific criteria such as delivery account requirements, quantity limits, and delivery schedules. To access the Send to Client feature, you can either click on Options in the top menu of the Lead List screen or right-click on the lead and choose Send to Client from the popup menu. When you select Send to Client, a popup window will appear where you can choose your delivery options and then click the Send button to deliver the lead to your client.

Managing lead returns is a big part of successfully managing your lead based business, we will cover the basics. 

Written by Gabriel Buck Updated over a week ago 

To manage your Returns proceed to Returns, located in the left-hand navigation under your Leads section. Tip: From this screen, you can use the Choose Columns feature to display critical pieces of information like Return Date and Date Added. Also, it is critical to your lead generation success that you manage returns and mark your leads that are returned as Approved or Approved and Return to Source. If you select Approved Send back to Source, the lead will be deducted from your Vendor Send Count and affect your Vendor Payout. 

Why Managing Returns is Important With LeadExec, you can set a return % threshold for your lead buyers. You will want to limit the percentage of total leads on order a client can return in most cases. You might want to restrict a buyer to 10% or 20% to ensure you do not let them return more than would be prudent for a successful relationship. Your buyers can return leads from the Client Portal, or you can Import Returns via an XLS file. We have also included a Pivot report feature with a pre-loaded report that helps you understand how many leads during a time frame your client has returned.

This article outlines the different types of campaigns and how they are used 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

Campaigns allow multiple types of leads to be routed from a lead source into your LeadExec account. You can configure as many campaigns under a lead source as you need. The two primary settings used in campaigns are the Channel and Lead Type settings. The Lead Type setting dictates which lead type is used, and the Channel setting dictates what kind of lead will be routed through the campaign... Web Leads, Phone Leads, Chat Leads, or Ping Post Leads. Each channel type offers different campaign setting options. We have dedicated articles for configuring campaigns for each channel type. Web Leads: Web Leads are the most common leads processed in LeadExec. This would be any leads from a self-managed landing page or website, third-party vendors, or a platform like Zapier. https://leadexechelp.clickpointsoftware.com/en/articles/8695673-creating-a-web-lead-campaign Phone Leads: The Phone Leads channel type sets a campaign for inbound calls to be routed through LeadExec's IVR Call Flow system and delivered to an available client or sales team agent. https://leadexechelp.clickpointsoftware.com/en/articles/8864572-creating-a-phone-lead-campaign Chat Leads: The Chat Lead channel type is intended for use with LeadExec's AI-powered chatbot system. The chatbot can be integrated with landing pages or websites, allowing you to collect lead data from a consumer on your website via chat rather than the user having to fill out a form. https://leadexechelp.clickpointsoftware.com/en/articles/8864574-creating-a-chat-lead-campaign Ping Post Leads: The Ping Post channel type is used for inbound ping posts from a third-party vendor and offers settings similar to web lead campaigns. https://leadexechelp.clickpointsoftware.com/en/articles/8864575-creating-a-ping-post-campaign

Field Requirements for PING 

Leads would include any leads from a self-managed landing page or website, a third-party vendor, or a platform like Zapier. Campaigns can be created within the Lead Source Details page or the Campaigns screen by clicking the Create button in the top menu. 

General Information 

The General Information tab is where you will enter the essential details for your Ping Post Leads campaign. Here you will assign the Lead Source, Campaign Name, Channel, and Lead Type. Aside from the Campaign Name, the Lead Source, Channel, and Lead Type settings cannot be changed after initially creating the campaign. 

Lead Source Assign the campaign to a Lead Source. Campaign Name Provide a name for the Campaign that indicates the type of leads and their location of origin. Channel Set the Channel type to be used for this campaign. In this case, you'll select PING/POST Leads. Lead Type Select the Lead Type to be used for this campaign. Campaigns can only process leads for a single lead type. If you have multiple Lead Types, you will need to create a campaign for each of the different Lead Types. Price Input the Price per lead for this Campaign. The price will be tracked throughout the system to allow you to run the most accurate Reports. Status A campaign must be set to Active to receive leads. Available Status Options Include 

Active Closed Inactive On Hold Late Suspended 

Require Authentication The Require Authentication setting determines if a lead source is required to use a Client ID and Client Secret when posting in leads. More information on using authentication credentials can be found in this article, LeadExec API Credentials. 

Quality Options 

The Quality Options tab provides options to help manage and maximize the quality of your leads. There can be a price per lead cost for some of the services listed in this section. 

Use Quality Control Using Quality Control is a way to gate leads, allowing users to validate or invalidate leads manually in the Quality Control bin. Validated leads will be processed for automated delivery, while invalided leads will be marked as QC returned to the client. You might use this feature to call-verify leads, or review leads from a new vendor before you send them to your buyers. Duplicate Day Setting This setting determines how far back the system checks for duplicate leads based on selected fields in your Lead Type. Standardize Address Apply industry standardization to the primary address field. Append City and State The system will update the city and state fields when a valid postal code and country are present. Mobile Check Verify if the lead's primary phone number is a mobile number. Geolocate IP Address Geolocation IP address of the lead. (fee may apply) 

Delivery Options 

The Delivery Options tab allows you to control how your leads will be delivered. 

Automation Method Here, you can choose the Automation Method you want to use for this campaign. Generally, you will want to use the System Default setting, which uses the Automation type set in the main Account Settings. However, there are certain use cases where you may want to deliver leads using a different Automation type for a specific campaign. This setting will override the main Automation settings of the account. 

Maximum Delivery Count The Maximum Delivery Count sets the maximum number of times that a single lead can deliver through this campaign. Delivers To The Delivers To option allows you to set an Exclusive Delivery Group on the campaign. You would use an Exclusive Delivery Group if you wanted leads from this campaign only to be delivered to a select group of clients. An Exclusive Group must be in place before using this setting. 

Quantity Limits 

Quantity Limits allow you to set the maximum number of leads you want to allow this campaign to accept in an Hourly, Daily, or Monthly time frame. 

Next Steps 

By clicking the Create button, your new campaign will be saved to the database. 

Once the campaign is created, you will be taken to the main campaign settings module. Here, you can configure the required settings for Ping Post campaigns on the Ping Options tab. Ping Options 

The Ping Options tab is where you can configure all settings related to Inbound Pings from your lead source for this campaign. To start, let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with how the Ping system operates before we delve into its settings. Understanding the Ping system. When a campaign is configured using the Ping Post channel, the system will validate that the lead source has first sent in a PING request, received an Order ID, and submitted the full lead within 5 minutes of receiving that Order ID. The PING system is used to qualify a lead's information before contact information for that lead is submitted to the system. For instance, the PING may ask whether the account has a buyer for a lead with a loan amount of $100,000, and the response will be either yes or no. If the response is yes, the source will receive an Order ID, which will be valid for 5 minutes. This information relates to the fields that are set in the Field Requirements section of this tab. 

_Revenue Requirement Allows you to set the required revenue amount. Profit Requirement Allows you to set the required profit amount. (Revenue minus lead cost must be at least "x")_ 

Profit Percentage Requirement Allows you to set the required profit percentage amount. 

Minimum Delivery Count Allows you to set a minimum estimated delivery count. For example, if set to "2", the system must find two matching clients that potentially take the lead. 

Qualify All Criteria Qualify clients using all criteria. Note: If no is selected, clients will be qualified only using the field values supplied on the PING request. 

Field Requirements for PING 

The Field Requirement setting is a crucial part of setting up your Ping Post campaign. This section allows you to specify the fields that you want your lead sources to provide in the Ping request. The Ping posting instructions will reflect the fields that you choose here. You can choose to set these fields as either required or optional. 

Once you've configured the Ping Options tab, you can move on to make any additional setting adjustments needed or save the campaign and move on to generate posting instructions for your lead source.

Ping Options 

The Ping Options tab is where you can configure all settings related to Inbound Pings from your lead source for this campaign. To start, let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with how the Ping system operates before we delve into its settings. Understanding the Ping system. When a campaign is configured using the Ping Post channel, the system will validate that the lead source has first sent in a PING request, received an Order ID, and submitted the full lead within 5 minutes of receiving that Order ID. The PING system is used to qualify a lead's information before contact information for that lead is submitted to the system. For instance, the PING may ask whether the account has a buyer for a lead with a loan amount of $100,000, and the response will be either yes or no. If the response is yes, the source will receive an Order ID, which will be valid for 5 minutes. This information relates to the fields that are set in the Field Requirements section of this tab. 

_Revenue Requirement Allows you to set the required revenue amount. Profit Requirement Allows you to set the required profit amount. (Revenue minus lead cost must be at least "x")_ 

Profit Percentage Requirement Allows you to set the required profit percentage amount. 

Minimum Delivery Count Allows you to set a minimum estimated delivery count. For example, if set to "2", the system must find two matching clients that potentially take the lead. 

Qualify All Criteria Qualify clients using all criteria. Note: If no is selected, clients will be qualified only using the field values supplied on the PING request. Field Requirements for PING 

The Field Requirement setting is a crucial part of setting up your Ping Post campaign. This section allows you to specify the fields that you want your lead sources to provide in the Ping request. The Ping posting instructions will reflect the fields that you choose here. You can choose to set these fields as either required or optional. 

Quality Options 

The Quality Options section provides options to help manage and maximize the quality of your leads. Duplicate Checks 

Check Rejected Leads Specify whether this Campaign should perform duplicate checks on previously rejected leads. Duplicate Day Setting This setting determines how far back the system checks for duplicate leads based on selected fields in your Lead Type. Append Duplicate Data When receiving a duplicate lead, update the existing lead with updated lead data. 

_Allow PING Duplicate API Check Allow this Campaign to utilize the duplicate check API to ensure non-duplicates before the final lead submission. Note: A fee may apply when using this feature; please refer to your subscription page for more information. Resend Deliveries When receiving a duplicate lead, resend the existing lead's deliveries._ 

Criteria 

In the Criteria section, you can set filters for the Campaign to allow only those leads with matching lead field criteria to be accepted. 

_To add incoming criteria, click Add. This will launch the Criteria Details window. Select Lead Field as the Criteria Type. Other Available Options_ 

Regular Expression - Allows you to use a regular expression as criteria. Calculate Expression - Allows you to use a calculated expression as criteria. Think of a Lead Source sending you mortgage balance 1 and mortgage balance 2, but they are unable to send you an LTV (Loan to Value Ratio), which mortgage lead buyers use to determine the viability of your leads. You can use a Calculated Expression to determine the LTV based on other fields of information provided by your lead source. 

Quantity Limits 

Quantity Limits allow you to set the maximum number of leads you want to allow this Campaign to accept in an Hourly, Daily, or Monthly time frame. 

Lead Validation 

Use Quality Control Using Quality Control is a way to gate leads, allowing users to validate or invalidate leads manually in the Quality Control bin. Validated leads will be processed for automated delivery, while invalid leads will be marked as QC and returned to the client. You might use this feature to call-verify leads, or review leads from a new vendor before you send them to your buyers. Default Reject Option In most cases, you will want to use the system default setting, Reject Back to Source. 

Reject Back to Source – This is the system default; this will take any rejected lead and mark it as one inside LeadExec. Move to Quality Control – This will take any rejected lead and move it directly to Quality Control for manual validation. Forward to Delivery – This will take any rejected lead and move it directly into automation for your clients to receive. 

Standardize Address Apply industry standardization to the primary address field. Append City and State The system will update the city and state fields when a valid postal code and country are present. Mobile Check Verify if the lead's primary phone number is a mobile number. Geolocate IP Address Geolocation IP address of the lead. (fee may apply) 

Compliance 

The Compliance tab offers settings for using LeadExec's TCPA and GDPR tools. 

TCPA 

To enable TCPA on your Campaign: 

1. Click Enable TCPA Services 2. Input the TCPA consent text you wish to have populated on your form into the 

TCPA Form Consent Text field. If you leave this field blank, it will default to the following text. 

_3. Default TCPA Consent Text: "I agree to be contacted on the number supplied using an automated telephone dialing system or prerecorded or artificial voice. I understand that providing my cell phone number is not required to purchase services and that I may revoke this permission at any time."_ 

4. Enter the email address of the LeadExec account manager in the Notification Email field. This is a required field. 

5. The Reject Lead for No Consent option allows you to reject any leads if consent is not given. 

GDPR LeadExec's GDPR options allow you to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, a set of EU data protection and privacy rules. 

Retention Policy - Set the number of days before any lead received is automatically removed from the system. Rejected Retention Policy - The number of days before rejected leads are automatically removed from the system. This works independently from the primary Retention Policy setting. 

Advance Options 

Assignments 

Default User Assignment You can choose which one of your users gets automatically assigned the leads from the list of registered users you have. Category You can also select a category that is used to denote further what type of leads a Lead Source is sending you for this Campaign. Group If you are an agency or company that buys leads for your sales divisions, you may have brands within the company, and you want to segment lead delivery for those brands. To simplify reporting, you will want to use the Lead Source Campaign Group. Let's say, for example, you are a company with four major brands. You receive leads specifically for these brands from a variety of lead sources. If so, you will want to segment your brands using the Lead Source Campaign Group. Once you have created the Campaign brands in this group, you can enable them when you set up your Lead Source Campaigns so that leads go directly to these brands. 

Automation 

_Use Delivery Queue Process lead delivery asynchronously. Note: By selecting no, response time back to the source will be affected Enable Automated Engagement When a web lead has been received, initiate a phone call using the call routing system to engage the lead. Note: Selected engagement numbers must have a call flow assigned. Please review ClickPoint's Acceptable Use Policy. Violation of this policy will result in this feature being disabled. Engage Using Text Messages Initiate a conversation through text messages if available. Note: The assigned number must have a message flow assigned. Please review ClickPoint's Acceptable Use Policy.

Use phone and email validation to create a lead score and improve lead quality. 

Written by Gabriel Buck Updated over a week ago 

Why is Lead Grading important? Lead Grading allows you to validate information on your leads by running checks on system fields set on your lead type. You are able to run grading on the following fields: 

Address – Ensures that the address is deliverable. Phone – Ensures that the phone number is registered with a telecom service provider. Email – Ensures that the email address is registered with an email service provider. IP Address – Checks to make sure that the IP is tied to the Address. Comments – Make sure that the comments section has information input. 

You are able to set up a custom grading scale with each letter grade allowing you to have leads follow certain routes. LeadExec will then show the grade of the lead inside of the reporting screens. 

Setting up Lead Grading 

Step 1: Navigate to the Settings section by clicking the Settings tab at the top, and clicking the Lead Grading option that will appear on the left side. Step 2: Once you are in the lead grading screen, enable the validation options you wish to use by selecting Enable. Do this to all validation options you want to use Step 3: Once you have all of your validation options set, the next step will be to set a point value each validation can earn if the lead passes. Step 4: Once the scores are in place it's time to set up your grade settings. At the bottom right of the lead grading section, you will see the highest possible score. This will assist you with inputting your grade scores. Step 5: Once the lows and highs are set for each letter it's time to set the action each grade will follow. To do this select the Action dropdown box. Step 6: Click Save and Agree located at the top left of the lead grading section. Step 7: The next step will be to implement this across all the campaigns receiving leads that you want to be graded. In order to do this, go to each campaign, and go under Grading Services. Then, change the lead grading option to "Yes, Perform lead grading". 

On the lead list window, some indicators will assist in identifying the lead grading score. 

The colored circles next to the green check mark indicate lead grading levels. In this system, green represents A, blue represents B, purple represents C, orange represents D, and red represents F. For more detailed information about the lead grading, you can open the lead and click on the lead grading details to view additional information.

Deliver leads to a certain set of clients in a group, based on criteria 

Written by Gabriel Buck Updated over a week ago 

Exclusive Groups allow a Lead Source Campaign to deliver to a specific set of clients contained in an Exclusive Group. Once you create an Exclusive Group, the LeadExec user can assign clients to that group. Exclusive Groups are relevant when routing leads from web forms to be directed to a single buyer, client, or sales team. You can set up Exclusive Groups in your LeadExec system under the Lead Sources, then proceed to Groups, then Exclusive. To add a new group, click the Create button in the menu. This will open the Exclusive Group details menu. You will then give the Exclusive Group a Description name. For example, imagine we are sending Exclusive leads to a group of three branches that receive mortgage leads from you. You will then set a Send Preference of 

Limit sending to only one item in the group Allow sending to multiple items in the group 

To apply an Exclusive Group to a Campaign, go to the Lead Source tab and open the desired Lead Source. Go to the Source Campaigns option and open the selected campaign. Then click on Additional Options at the bottom of the left side menu. Once on that screen, find the Exclusive Options section. 

Now, when a lead is received from a Lead Source tied to that group, the system will only deliver to one client located within that group and will ignore all other clients located in the system.

Campaign Groups set on a Lead Source allow you to tag brands or groups that you receive leads and distribute leads too 

Written by Gabriel Buck Updated over a week ago 

If you are an agency or company that buys leads for your sales divisions, you may have brands within the company, and you want to segment lead delivery for those brands. To simplify reporting, you will want to use the Lead Source Campaign Group. Let's say, for example, you are a company with four major brands. You receive leads specifically for these brands from a variety of lead sources. If this is the case, you will want to segment your brands using the Lead Source Campaign Group. We will create four teams or brands for demonstration purposes, and your lead sources will send leads directly to these brands or teams. 

Once you have created the Campaign brands in this group, you can enable them when you set up your Lead Source Campaigns, so that leads go directly to these brands. Proceed to Campaigns, select a Campaign, Open Campaign, select Additional Options, scroll to the bottom, and select the Campaign Group.

Details on generating posting instructions for campaigns 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

Posting Instructions serve as documentation to provide your lead sources or web developer, detailed information on how to post leads to your LeadExec account. Leads can be posted to the lead receiver via JSON, HTML Form(URL-encoded), or XML. Posting Instructions can be generated from either the Campaign List or the Lead Source Details page. To generate posting instructions, select Posting Instructions from the top menu of the screen. Here, you can choose the content type for the instructions. Click Export to save the file as either PDF or Excel. 

It is also important to mention the account identifiers that are included in the posting instructions. These are required fields for your lead source to use in each request posted to LeadExec. There will be three identifiers outlined in the instructions unique to your account. LID - Lead Type Identifier VID - Lead Source Identifier AID -Campaign Identifier Generating PING POST posting instructions. In order to generate posting instructions for PING POST, you need to export the instructions for both the PING and POST. You can do this by clicking on the triangle icon in the menu located next to the posting instructions button. Once clicked, you will have the option to choose and export both sets of instructions. On the PING instructions, you'll notice that the pings have a dedicated endpoint they will be posted to. This is different from the lead receiver endpoint noted in the POST instructions. Also, to note, the PING receiver only accepts JSON or URL-encoded requests.

Verifying Emails and Domains for CAN-SPAM 

Steps to verify email addresses and domains to be CAN-SPAM compliant 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

As of October 2023, our email partner has updated email delivery requirements per CAN-SPAM rules and guidelines. To provide a seamless experience using LeadExec, we have made it easy to adhere to these new guidelines. It is recommended that this verification process is completed by October 31, 2023, to stay in compliance. Requirement to Send Email To protect your Sender Identity and stay in compliance, you must authenticate your domain or verify your email via the Single Sender verification process in LeadExec Web. All future features, especially those that pertain to compliance, will be found in LeadExec Web. We have taken customer feedback, including many new updates, and will continue to do so in this version of the software. What do you need to do? All customers using email delivery for lead notifications via the LeadExec solution must authenticate their domain or use single-sender verification. It's a relatively painless process to ensure email delivery runs smoothly. Please proceed to LeadExec Web through the URL below to make the necessary updates. LeadExec Web: https://leadexec.clickpointsoftware.com/ When you first log in, you will notice the banner, which will direct you to a popup window outlining all email addresses that require verification. Here, you can begin the Single Sender verification process for each email used in the account. 

In the case of larger enterprise accounts that use a substantial number of different email addresses, verifying the domain rather than individual email addresses may be more efficient. For Verified Domains, please visit the new Email Settings section of the Settings page, which also contains the Verified Email Senders list and Link Branding. 

Verified Email Senders These are single-sender verifications that allow users to validate an outbound email address. This is required to send an email from LeadExec using that email address as the From address. This includes email delivery as well as any other email communications throughout the system, such as forgot password and MFA emails when using custom domains on the client portal. Verified Domains This allows an account to validate an entire domain as a valid From address. When a domain is validated, a company is able to send from any address as long as it matches that domain. Link Branding This allows an account to validate a domain to be used as the link path within lead delivery emails. For example, when setting up a link to the client portal (in email delivery), the URL rewrite from a SendGrid link to a link under the link domain. This will improve deliverability as the links in the email will match the sender's domain. Common Questions Question: What is Single Sender Verification? Answer: To protect your sender reputation and to uphold legitimate sending behavior, we require customers to verify their Sender Identities. Single Sender Verification is an easy method to verify your Sender Identity when you don't have access to the DNS settings for your domain. Question: What is Domain Authentication? Answer: When sending email, you must set Domain Name System (DNS) records on the domain to: 1. Communicate to receiving email servers that you own the domain emails are sent from. 2. Verify that you have given the sending email server permission to send email on behalf of the domain. Domain Authentication, formerly known as Domain Whitelabel, is Twilio SendGrid's process for domain setup and configuring the DNS entries that grant us permission to send email on your behalf. After completing Domain Authentication, your recipients will no longer see "via sendgrid.net" included with the From address of your messages. Both receiving email servers and human recipients will be more likely to trust the legitimacy of your messages, which means you're more likely to reach an inbox than a spam folder. More Information To learn about the recent changes in email send regulations, please visit our blog article below.

Custom Domain 

The DNS update requires some action on your part initially, and once that's done, we can proceed with making the change on our end. 1. You must create a CNAME record that points the domain (whatever your custom domain, for Example leadexec-clientportal.Testaccount.net) 2. You also need to create a TXT record Example: 

Once you have done, these two things with your hosting provider, we can then update on our end Login Caption: Customizing the text displayed on the login page enhances the user experience. 

Client Portal URL: The URL should reflect the organization's brand identity and be consistent with the domain name or subdomain used for other company websites or services. This helps reinforce brand recognition and trust among your clients. 

Lead Source Portal URL: It helps centralize lead information, allowing businesses to monitor the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns, track lead interactions, and streamline the lead management process

Client Distribution options in LeadExec allow you to change the way automation works for your entire system. The base defaults we have are 

Price Weighted Percentage Round Robin Priority 

_To set automation settings, Select the Default Automation dropdown and select an option. Click Save Settings. Price Automation Price automation Works by taking into account the price listed on your delivery accounts and ordering the client in order of highest to lowest. Price Optimization: If this option is set to yes, the system will take into account which client pays the most when sending the lead. Note: Price Automation does not have any automation preferences. Priority Automation Priority automation allows you to give your clients a priority order that is enforced when a lead enters the system. Click on Configure Automation Settings to save your changes and edit your priority. Priority is Determined with 0 being the highest priority. Anything higher than 0 is deemed a lower priority For example, if a lead were to come into the system right now, the order our clients would be scanned is 0,1,2,3,4,5. Round Robin Round Robin Delivery will ensure that the lead delivers clients receive leads in sequential order ensuring that the leads are even distributed For Example. You have 3 clients._ 

A B C 

As leads come into the system it will evenly distribute between the clients. for example during this time, 5 leads have entered your system. This is how they distributed 

A II B II C I 

Note: round robin does not have a configure automation preference item. Click save settings to implement Round Robin. 

Weighted Weighted distribution allows you to set weights on each client which determines how many leads they should receive. The percentage of leads a particular client receives goes up and down depending on time frame. Click on Configure Automation Settings to save your changes and edit your weights. Base automation Type: 

If two clients share the same weight the system will determine who gets the lead by the base automation type you can choose to have the system look at the clients via:

For industry best practices, we recommend at least eight characters required for a password, at least one upper case letter, at least one numeric character, and at least one unique character. You can also enforce password changes after a certain amount of days from this screen.

Use distribution lists to deliver to large lists of zip codes, postal codes, and more 

Written by Gabriel Buck Updated over a week ago 

Distribution Lists are useful when using large zip code or postal code tables for lead delivery to one or more clients. To set up a Distribution List, click on Settings. From the settings tab, click on Distribution Lists. Click on New Once you have added the basic details, you can either add zip codes or postal codes manually or import them. 

Description – This is where you assign a description for your distribution list. LeadType – Select the Lead Type that this list will apply LeadField – What field will this list be using for criteria Link Field - Field on the lead that should be used as criteria to qualify this list for a lead. For example, the Link Field of Country could be used to select a certain list for different countries. Link Value - The value of the link field is used to qualify this list against the lead. For example, A link field value of "The United States" with a Link Field of Country would verify that the lead has the United States as the value of the country and would not apply this list unless that condition was met. Default Client – This value is used to determine where the lead should go if no list items apply to the lead. For Example: If a postal code list is being scanned, and the postal code is not found in the list. Then send the lead to the client selected to ensure there are no non-delivered leads. Status – Enabled or Disabled 

Note: If you are importing a file, make sure it is in a *.xlsx or *.xls 

Distribution List Assignments 

Once you have imported your zip codes or postal codes, you can edit or update the Assignment of this list. 

Add New Assignment – Manually add an assignment to the list. Remove Assignment – Will remove a value from the list Import Assignments Refresh – allows you to import an assignment, such as zip codes, via a .xls file

Utilize system notifications to warn your team about urgent items within LeadExec 

Written by Gabriel Buck Updated over a week ago 

LeadExec Notifications are handy when you have many lead buyers and need to stay on top of lead deliveries. Notification Use Cases 

For instance, knowing when a lead buyer's cap is almost at its maximum is vital for ensuring that their lead flow is not interrupted. Knowing when a buyer's credit card declines are helpful; your team can find out what happened and get them to enter a new card. Knowing when you receive new lead orders is essential to planning around your marketing expense to acquire more leads. Understanding if a buyer is rejecting your leads could help you pinpoint a technical issue. Knowing when a client has their order filled and has more lead volume could help your team know they should reach out to the buyer and initiate another order. 

These are just a handful of the valuable scenarios where Notifications can help you run a successful lead-based business. To create Notifications, go to Settings, then Notifications. 

Steps to Create a Notification: 

1. Click on Create 2. From here, select the type of Notification you would like to enable 3. You can give the Notification a custom name if you want. You might do this if it's a 

Notification for a specific role or person within your company. 4. You can Enable the new Notification. 5. You can select who will receive this Notification and the method they will receive 

it, either email or text SMS. 6. Once you create the Notification, you will get a slide-out with additional options. 7. Based on the type of Notification, you will get options for the Notification.

Setting up Lead Grading 

All Collections System Settings Lead Source Settings 

Lead Source Settings - Lead Grading 

Lead Source Settings - Lead Grading 

Master account settings for Lead Grading. Use phone and email validation to create a lead score and improve lead quality. 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

Why is Lead Grading important? Lead Grading allows you to validate information on your leads by running checks on system fields set on your lead type. You are able to run grading on the following fields: 

_Address – Ensures that the address is deliverable. Phone – Ensures that the phone number is registered with a telecom service provider. Email – Ensures that the email address is registered with an email service provider. IP Address – Checks to make sure that the IP is tied to the Address. Comments – Make sure that the comments section has information input. Note: For the Address check in lead grading to pass, it's necessary to include the complete mailing address, including system fields such as Address, City,_ 

State, Zip, and Country. Otherwise, the verification will not succeed. 

You are able to set up a custom grading scale with each letter grade allowing you to have leads follow certain routes. LeadExec will then show the grade of the lead inside of the reporting screens. 

Setting up Lead Grading 

Step 1: Navigate to the Settings section by clicking the Settings tab at the top, and clicking the Lead Grading option that will appear on the left side. Step 2: Once you are in the lead grading screen, enable the validation options you wish to use by selecting Enable. Do this to all validation options you want to use Step 3: Once you have all of your validation options set, the next step will be to set a point value each validation can earn if the lead passes. Step 4: Once the scores are in place it's time to set up your grade settings. At the bottom right of the lead grading section, you will see the highest possible score. This will assist you with inputting your grade scores. Step 5: Once the lows and highs are set for each letter it's time to set the action each grade will follow. To do this select the Action dropdown box. Step 6: Click Save and Agree located at the top left of the lead grading section. Step 7: The next step will be to implement this across all the campaigns receiving leads that you want to be graded. In order to do this, go to each campaign, and go under Grading Services. Then, change the lead grading option to "Yes, Perform lead grading".

Lead Type Settings - Force ID's 

Use Force ID's to segment your leads to be delivered in real-time directly to an exclusive client. 

Written by Gabriel Buck Updated over a week ago 

_LeadExec allows the ability to bypass the distribution system and target a specific client for delivery by using Force IDs. For example, if you have a contact form that targets leads for a specific client, you could use Force IDs. To set this up, you would first go into your lead type and create a field called ForceID, be sure to set the system field to ForceID as this tells LeadExec to use this field for that purpose._ 

Once you have created the lead field, you need to tell LeadExec which client field to run this off of. By default the system uses the client ID as the force ID. Meaning if you send in the client ID in the ForceID field, this will target that specific client. But you can run the force ID off any client field. For example, if your form system has specific IDs that you need to map in LeadExec, you can request that ClickPoint support create a custom client field called form ID on the client record. This would allow you to use that specific ID from your form and map it to a client within LeadExec. If you are using client ID then the next step is not required. To select a specific client field to be used as the force ID, go to Settings, then Clients. Once there you can update the dropdown with the field you want to map to the incoming force ID value. 

After you have configured your lead field, and mapped your delivery force ID to a client field (if needed). If you send in a lead with the mapped value or client ID, the system will target that specific client.

API Access Settings - Credentials 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

The API Access Credential settings allow you to create user authentication credentials that delegate user access to the APIs and lead receiver for increased security. When creating user credentials, a client ID and client secret are assigned by the system and used for authentication in API calls. How to set up API credentials: Go to the Settings tab and select API Credentials in the left-hand menu. 

Click the New button in the top menu. This will generate a popup window where you will name the user credentials in the description field. The system will generate a unique client ID and client secret for authenticating API calls. Here you can also set the allowed scopes for the credentials: Account API, Data API, and Lead Receiver. 

_Credentials can be enabled and disabled. However, the allowed scopes can only be set when creating the credentials and are not editable after the initial creation. You must record the client's secret, as the system will hide this information once the settings are saved and will not be further accessible. Using API Credentials: The client ID and client secret are used in the authentication call to the API, which generates an access token. The access token will then be used to authenticate the API calls made to the Data API or Account API. Access tokens are valid for 3600 seconds._ 

More information on the authentication call can be found in the API documentation: https://api.leadexec.net/#auth_token. Using Lead Receiver Credentials: Once you have created credentials in your Settings, you can choose which campaigns require authentication when posting leads to the lead receiver. The Require Authentication setting is located under the General Information tab of your Lead Source Detail; proceed to Campaigns, then Edit. Here you can specify if authentication is required for the campaign. 

Note: If authentication is required and an invalid access token is passed, the system will not show that lead on the search screen.

Whitelisting vs Blacklisting IP addresses: Whitelisting an IP address enables you to control who can (or cannot) access the API by setting up allowed IP addresses in Access Control. Any IP addresses set to "Allow" in access control will be granted access to the API for users from that IP address. Blacklisting an IP address will work the opposite, where IP addresses set to "Deny" will be blocked from accessing the API, while all others will be allowed. This setting only applies to the account API and data API. The lead receiver access control is handled through lead source settings. Lead Source Access Control Whitelisting IP addresses for API access 

1. Gear (Top right) 2. Access Control (Bottom left sidebar) 3. Add IP Address (or select an IPAddress to edit 4. Type in an IP Address or IP Range 5. Allow in the dropdown 6. Save 

This will only allow the set IPs to access the API, all others will be denied 

Blacklisting IP addresses from API access Similar to whitelisting, you will follow the same steps above, but in this case, instead of selecting Allow, you will select Deny. This will only allow the set IPs to access the API, all others will be allowed.

Orders can also be closed by end date when that setting is being used. You can also choose the default setting of No Renewal if the order should not renew. Delivery Account: Orders can be tied to either all delivery accounts or one-to-one with a single delivery account. Order Type: Configure the order to be based on lead quantity or a set dollar amount. Depending on the Order Type, the system will then allow you to set either the quantity amount or the dollar amount of the order. Once you've completed this part of the configuration, click "Create," and the system will display the order details with more available options. 

Dollar Based Order Details 

General 

The first section of the General tab displays the primary settings of the order created in the previous popup window, where you can make any necessary changes. Here, you also have three often used settings: Auto Charge, Generate Invoice, and Max Return Percentage. Auto Charge: Automatically process a charge at the start of a new or renewed order, or when the order is complete Generate Invoice: Automatically generate invoices when processing automatic payments. Max Return Percentage: Set the amount of leads you are willing to accept as returns from your clients. Items 

The Items tab displays the order of item(s). Each item contains the settings relating to the order's properties, Item Type, in this case, Reserve Dollar Bank, Total Price, and Dollar Item Fill Limit. Item Type: Sets the order to be based on dollar amount or quantity. Total Price: Total price of the order for dollar based orders. Dollar Item Fill Limit: This setting is essential for dollar based orders that renew. In many cases, leads will be sold at different price points to a client, either because the client has multiple delivery accounts with different price points or when leads are being sold to the client via ping post. This setting allows you to set a threshold for the system to know when to renew the order. For example, if an order is set at $200 and the Dollar Item Fill Limit is set to $12, the system will renew the order once the threshold of $188 is reached. The system will then credit any remaining balance to the payment of the renewed order. Payments 

Lastly, you can Apply a Payment to any Order. The selections for Apply Payment are the following: 

Check Bank Transfer Cash Mobile Payment Credit Adjustment 

Any payments toward the order will be displayed on this screen. 

Quantity Based Order Details 

General 

The first section of the General tab displays the primary settings of the order created in the initial popup window. Here, you can make any changes if necessary. Here, you also have three often used settings: Auto Charge, Generate Invoice, and Max Return Percentage. Auto Charge: Automatically process a charge at the start of a new or renewed order, or when the order is complete Generate Invoice: Automatically generate invoices when processing automatic payments. Max Return Percentage: Set the amount of leads you are willing to accept as returns from your clients. 

The items tab displays the order of item(s). Each item contains settings relating to the order's properties, Item Type, in this case, Lead Quantity, Quantity, and Per Lead Price. Item Type: Sets whether the order is based on dollar amount or quantity. Quantity: Specify the quantity of leads being ordered. Price Per Lead: Set a per lead price including discounts. Leaving this setting blank will default to the price set on the delivery account. Payments 

Lastly, you can Apply a Payment to any Order. The selections for Apply Payment are the following: 

Check Bank Transfer Cash Mobile Payment Credit Adjustment 

Any payments toward the order will be displayed on this screen as well. 

Orders with Declined Payments 

Sometimes, you will find your client's payment for an order is declined by the payment processing service. In this case, the system will set the order status to Pending. When the lead is in the Pending status, it will prevent the order from receiving leads and will provide the option to approve the order manually. 

Approving Pending Orders 

To approve a pending order with a declined payment, go to the Orders tab in the client details screen and select the order in the Pending status. When the pending order is selected, the "Update Status" menu item will change to "Approve." By clicking the Approve button, a popup window will appear, giving you the option to approve the order. The Auto Charge option will be enabled by default. With this setting enabled, the system will process the payment again. If the payment is declined again, the order will remain pending. Alternatively, you can approve the pending order with Auto Charge disabled. In this case, the system will reopen the order without reprocessing the payment.

This is generally used by businesses who are delivering leads to intercompany sales teams. 

To create a Portal user, navigate to Portal Users under the Clients section of the left-hand menu. Next, click the Create button. This will generate a popup menu to complete the User Details. In the Permissions section, you will select the clients the user will have access to in the Client Portal.

Utilize client groups for more advanced delivery where you are delivering to a company with multiple locations 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

Client groups can be used to group existing clients in your system to control delivery. With client groups, you can: 

Send leads to clients while having only one method. Assign multiple clients to a single delivery method. Send leads to multiple endpoints based on criteria 

To begin setting client groups, Select Client under the Groups submenu in the Clients section of the left-hand menu. Select "Create Group" and name your group. 

Inside your client group you can assign: 

Default Delivery – This will be the main delivery method your clients use when assigned to a client group. This is set up like a normal client Delivery. (Please refer to Setting Up Client Delivery for more details) Force Delivery – This will force the delivery of a lead and will over ride the default delivery (Please refer to Setting Up Client Delivery for more details) Delivery Overrides – These can be assigned to Override the Default Delivery to a client if certain criteria is met.

How to Create Delivery Groups 

Delivery Groups allow you to set specific automation rules for a group of clients 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

Delivery Groups 

Delivery groups are used to group clients or delivery accounts and customize the type of automation used for delivering leads within the group. For example, you have Client A, Client B, and Client C and want to deliver round-robin between only Client A and Client B. You would add Client A and Client B to a delivery group set to round-robin automation. The system will then round-robin the delivery between Client A and Client B, and after it has attempted delivery within that group, it will then move to Client C if the lead can still be sold. 

Delivery groups process delivery ahead of the system's general automation, so the system will scan all delivery groups ahead of processing your other clients. 

How to Create a Delivery Group 

Navigate to the Groups section under client and select Delivery. Select Create and name your group. Next, select the Distribution Type for the group. 

Price : Priority: Round Robin: Weighted: Percentage: Geolocation: 

Once your group is created, you can drag and drop the Delivery Groups listed in order of priority. From there, you need to assign clients to the group. This can be done one of two ways, on the client level or delivery account level. Client-Level Delivery Group Setting: A client can be assigned to a delivery group by selecting a group in the drop-down within the Settings section of the client detail page. This will allow the system to scan all delivery accounts of the client. Delivery Account-Level Delivery Group Setting: This setting is found in the Advance Settings tab of the delivery account and will tell the system only to scan the delivery account assigned to the group rather than all of the client's delivery accounts.

Integrations - Unbounce Form Intake 

How to use third party solutions for lead intake 

Written by Gabriel Buck Updated over a week ago 

In order to integrate your Unbounce Forms with your LeadExec account, you will need to follow the steps located in this article. You will need to generate your posting instructions from within your LeadExec account before moving forward with your form integration. 

Once you have your posting documents you are going to want to log into your Unbounce account and select the form that you wish to integrate with LeadExec. 

This will bring you to your Form settings page. Click 'Edit' to bring up the form to begin the first steps of the integration. 

Once you are on your form page click on the field section of your form to bring up the field settings. 

Add all of the fields that you wish to capture on your form with in this section. Use your Posting documents to assist you with how to set up each field. ("The field names that you see here are strictly to be shown on the form. Do not worry about making them match with the Field Name column inside of your posting instructions those will be used when we set up the web hook integration into LeadExec.") From here we are going to get to set up the required fields to post into your LeadExec account. Each post into LeadExec will require you to input VID,LID and AID. Each one of these fields has a static value. To add these fields you will click Hidden Field. Give name the field VID and for Default Value use the value provided on your posting instructions. VID: 6240 LID: 4439 AID: 13278 

You are going to do this for every field that you want to enter your system with a static value. Once you have all of the fields on your posting instructions added to this section click Done and Save the page. Once you save the page click on the Unbounce Logo at the top left of your screen this will bring you back to your Forms Page. Select the form you edited. Once you are on the Forms Setting Page locate the WebHook: POST to URL option under the Leads & Form Integration section. 

Click on the WebHook: POST to URL option. This will bring you to the Webhook Wizard. Take the URL on your LeadExec posting instructions and paste it into the URL for POST text box. 

Click 'Continue'. Select Configure Field Mapping this will allow you to set the fields on your form to post over to your LeadExec Account. For each of the fields in this section, you are going to want to select the dropdown located under the WebHook (POST to URL) Field section and select Add New Field this option is the last one on the dropdown. Create the field name for the field you select. In this example, we are doing the Name field. LeadExec expects the field to be posted over as Name. Once you are done click Add Remote Field do this for each one of the fields on this section. 

Once you have this done you are good to click Done. This will allow leads to come into your LeadExec account from your Unbounce web forms! 

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to your Account manager or input a ticket and support will make sure to assist you.

Ping-Post Delivery Method 

Ping-Post Delivery Method 

Inital steps for creating an outbound Ping Post delivery method 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

Understanding Ping Post Delivery 

Using Ping Post allows you to deliver partial lead data to buyers before the lead is sold. The "ping" allows clients to preview the lead, and bid if they are willing to buy it. A ping might include the lead's state, loan amount, or credit profile but not the actual contact information. If the buyer responds with a successful response and the bid price meets your revenue requirements, LeadExec will then send the complete lead data to the buyer in the "post." 

Configuring a Ping Post Delivery 

In LeadExec, configuring a Ping Post delivery requires the use of two delivery methods: the PING delivery method, which is typically a standard HTTP Webhook delivery method, and the POST delivery method, using the PING/POST delivery method type. These two delivery methods work together through the delivery account when using the PING/POST delivery method as the primary delivery method. This article will guide you through setting up the PING/POST delivery method type, which handles the "post" component of the process. You will also need to set up the "ping" using an HTTP Webhook delivery method. 

_To get started, click the Create button in the upper left-hand corner in Delivery Methods. This will generate a popup window to input the basic settings of the delivery method. Description – Name your delivery method. Delivery Type – Select PING/POST for your delivery type. Lead Type – Select the lead type the delivery method will be based on. Note that this setting cannot be changed after the delivery has been created. Environment – If your client has a separate test endpoint, you can change this setting to "Testing." Otherwise, leave this setting to the default of "Production." Once you’ve made your selections, hit the Create button. This will move you to the main settings page of the delivery method, starting with the General settings tab. Here, you can review the settings you just saved. If your settings look good, you can move on to the next tab. Next article: URL Endpoint Tab >_

Ping Post field mappings allow you to configure the field names the receiving system expects to the fields set on your lead type. 

Written by Chris Arenas Updated over a week ago 

To get started with your field mappings, you'll want to add the Ping reference field. This system field references the ping response from the client and pulls in the unique identifier for accepted pings. The receiving system will require the correct identifier to be included with the full lead data to match the post with the ping. In the example shown above, the receiving system expects "OrderID" as the field name. 

Once you have the Ping Reference field configured, you can begin to map the rest of your lead fields. Start by clicking the Import button in the top menu of the Mappings tab. This will generate a popup window containing all the lead fields from your lead type. This is where you will map the existing lead fields in your lead type to the field names your client’s system expects based on their posting documentation. You can customize each field name or use the default values set on the lead type.
